 * Log2(16) = 4 -> LCM(4, 8) = 8
 *
 * Notice that the least common multiple of 3 (the number of bits in an octal
 * digit) and 8 (the number of bits in a byte) is 24. We cannot encode one byte
 * at a time, and must instead encode three bytes at a time.
 *
 * What if the input is not a multiple of 3 bytes? The solution is to pad the
 * input with null-bytes to the next largest multiple of 3. When processing the
 * last chunk of three bytes, we remove the octal digits that come from the
 * padding and replace them with a padding character, conventionally '='.
 *
 * For example, {0, 0, 0} encodes as "00000000" in base8,
 * while, {0, 0} encodes as "000000==" in base8,
 * and, {0} encodes as "000=====" in base8.
